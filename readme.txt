# Towers of Hanoi

  This simulation was originally written by me in December of 2023 after I 
  completed my discrete structures class (CS 2800). I wrote this in java as I
  had just completed my first data structures class in java.

# To run:

  This simulation uses a Swing window and GUI. To compile, you can either use 
  your preferred IDE and run it from GameManager.java, or use the following
  commands. (With JDK installed 
  https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/21/install/overview-jdk-installation.html)

  Navigate to /src

  $ javac Components/*.java Game/*.java

  $ java Game/GameManager
